# GOJO GAME 🎮

Welcome to **GOJO GAME** – a fun and interactive way to learn the numerical positions of letters in the English alphabet! Whether you're a student, a teacher, or just someone looking to sharpen your skills, GOJO provides a simple yet engaging interface to help you master letter positions with ease.

## How It Works 🚀

In GOJO, a random letter is displayed on the screen, and your task is to input its correct numerical position in the alphabet. For example, if the letter **A** appears, you would enter **1**; if it's **Z**, you would enter **26**. The game keeps track of your correct and incorrect answers and presents you with a summary at the end of each session.

### Features 🌟
